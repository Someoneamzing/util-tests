This section is a complete tutorial on the spell system of this game. It will teach you about JavaScript and the options available inside the spells, as well as provide example spells that you can load and edit.

## What are spells?
Spells are small JavaScript scripts that you can write. These scripts get run on different conditions. The current available conditions are:
- Activate on attack
- Activate on use
These spells allow you to do anything you can think of, as long as you have access to it.

## Restrictions
The main restriction for anyone is what level of spell they have. There are currently 2 in-game levels and 1 debugging level. These levels are:
- Low
- Medium
*Not the most creative names I know*

Additionally the spells have a size limit. This limit is fixed at 1600 bytes. This may not seem like much, bit you'd be surprised at how much you can do.

The only other limitation is your imagination. If you can think of it, you can do it.

## How to start
The first step is to create a spell. To do this open the spell editor and click the plus button. Enter a name for your spell, something like `hello_world` will suffice.

Hit enter and then click on the dropdown menu in the spell editor. Select your spell from the list.

Once the spell is open you can start typing. Once you have finished writing your code you can hit the compile button. This will save your spell and compile it ready for use. Once the spell is compiled you can hit run.

Any output from the spell will show up in the log on the right side of the editor. Here's an example:

Don't worry about what all the text means just yet, we'll cover that in a later section.

From here on you can look at the [next section of the tutorial](./tutorial-1-1.md) or you can browse the [documentation](../../home.md) to get an in-depth explanation of everything.
