# Section 1.1
This section will cover the very basics of JavaScript. If you already have experience with JS you can skip to [Section 2.1](../tutorial-2-1.md) for the spell specific information.

## What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the three core languages of the web. JavaScript is what makes web pages *"do"* things. It controls what happens when you click a button or enter a value in a calculator, it is even the main language of this game, albeit in a varying form (We'll get into this later). JavaScript allows a webpage to be dynamic and change based on user input, rather than displaying static text.

## Some key terms
Below is a list of key terms, and their definitions, that will be used throughout this tutorial.

Don't worry if you don't understand all of these words. They will become more clear as you move along.

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Code | Code is a set of instructions for a computer to follow. These instructions are written in a programming language, in this case JavaScript. |
| Syntax | Syntax is the set of rules about how code is written. What brackets go where and when you should use different symbols, much like how spoken languages have rules about the ordering of words and the placement of punctuation. |
| Dynamic | Dynamic means changing over time or in response to actions. |
| Static | Static means unchanging, in the case of HTML once the page loads it is static, unchanging. Unless you add JavaScript. |
| Keyword | Keywords are the most basic commands in a programming language. In JavaScript some keywords are `if`, `for`, `try` etc. They instruct the code on what to do. |
| Terminal | A terminal is the most basic form of programming. It takes in a command from a user and runs it, displaying the result on screen. |
| Execute | To execute a piece of code means to get the computer to follow the instructions. In the case of these spells that means clicking the run button. |
| Script | A script is a piece of code that can be run. Most often scripts are in the form of files saved with a particular extension such as `.js`, `.php` and `.cpp`, but scripts can also be code run from a terminal. |
| Algorithm | An algorithm is a set of steps or rules to follow. Algorithms can be anything from how to do long division to how to construct a CPU. |

## How this tutorial is going to work
Throughout this tutorial we will explain the basics of JavaScript. In each section there will be a main topic and in that topic there will be examples and explanations. We encourage you to follow along and try out the scripts in the spell editor. Most if not all of the examples provided will work in the spells.  
Two key notes:
- Avoid copy-pasting examples. You will learn a lot more if you write the code by hand, even if you copy it word for word.
- Don't be afraid to mess up. One of the biggest parts of coding is making mistakes and finding out how to fix them. Don't fear the scary red errors, treat them as a helping hand in finding problems and bugs.
